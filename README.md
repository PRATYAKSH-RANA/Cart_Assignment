Interactive Shopping Cart web app built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Features dynamic product cards, add/remove cart items, quantity control, real-time total calculations, price-based styling, and live product search using DOM manipulation and events.

Probelem Description:


1.View Products: Display a list of pre-defined products (e.g., mobile, laptop, headphones) with their name and price. Products  should be displayed as styled cards using HTML and CSS.
2. Add and Remove Items: Each product card must have an 'Add to Cart' button. When clicked, the product should appear in the   cart dynamically. Each cart item should show product name, price,quantity, and subtotal. Cart items should have options to increase quantity (+), decrease quantity(-), and remove item completely.
3.Cart Calculations: Use JavaScript operators (+, -, *, /, comparison operators) to update totals. Implement a function calculateTotal() that recalculates total items and total price of the cart.
Expensive items (price > 1000) should be styled differently using CSS + JS DOM.
4.Search Functionality: Include a search bar at the top. Typing into the search bar should dynamically filter products by name (using the oninput event).
5.Event Handling: Use JavaScript events such as onclick (Add to Cart, Remove,Increase/Decrease quantity) and oninput (Live search filter). Prevent page reloads (since no will be used).

  Functional Requirements
• Must use JavaScript Functions (addToCart(), removeFromCart(), updateQuantity(),calculateTotal(), renderCart()).
• Must use JavaScript Template Literals for rendering product and cart HTML dynamically.
• Must manipulate the HTML DOM (getElementById, querySelector, innerHTML, classList).
• Must style the UI with CSS for clarity and user-friendliness.

Expected Outcome:
A responsive and interactive shopping cart system. Users can add, remove, and update products in
real-time. Totals are automatically updated using JavaScript operators. Products can be filtered via
the search bar. Application runs completely on the client side (HTML, CSS, JavaScript only).
